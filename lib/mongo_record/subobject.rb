  # A MongoRecord::Subobject is an MongoRecord::Base subclass that disallows
  # many operations. Subobjects are those that are contained within and
  # saved with some other object.

  # Using MongoRecord::Subobject is completely optional.

  # As an example, say a Student object contains an Address. You might want
  # to make Address a subclass of Subobject so that you don't accidentally
  # try to save an address to a collection by itself.
